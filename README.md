# CORDE Concordance Export Tool
This code has been developed to export concordance data from CORDE (a historical corpus of the Spanish language, created by the Real Academia Espa√±ola) into Excel format. The purpose of this script is to assist researchers, linguists, and language enthusiasts who need to analyze and work with linguistic data from CORDE outside the online platform.
